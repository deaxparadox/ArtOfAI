# Skewness

Skewness is a statistical measure that assesses the asymmetry of a probability distribution. It quantifies the extent to which the data is skewed or shifted to one side.

Position skewness indicates a longer tail on the right side of the distribution, while negative skewness indicates a longer tail on the left side. Skewness helps in understanding the shape and outlier in a dataset.
