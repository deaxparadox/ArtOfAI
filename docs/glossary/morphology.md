# Morphology

It is the study of the way words are built up from smaller meaning-bearing units called **morphemes**. Two broad classes of morphemes can be distinguished: **stems**--then central morpheme of the word, supply the main meaning--and-**affixes**--adding "additional" meanings of various kinds. So, for example, the word *gox* consists of one morpheme (the morpheme *fox*) and the words *cats* consists of two: the morpheme *cat* and the morphene *-s*. A **morphological parser** takes a word like *cats* and parses it into the two morphemes *cat* and *s*.

The most sophisticated methods of lemmatization involve complete **morphogical parsing** of the word.
