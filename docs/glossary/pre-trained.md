# Pre-trained model

A pre-trained model is a saved network that was previous trained on a large dataset, typically on a large-scale image-classification task. You either use the pretrained model as is or use tranfer learning to customer this model to a given task.

The initution behind transfer learning for image classification is that if a model is trained on a large and general enough dataset, this model will effectively serve as a generic model of the visual world.
