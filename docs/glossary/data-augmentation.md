# Data augmentation

Data augmentation is a technique used to articially expand a dataset by applying transformations to existing data. It is commonly used in machine learning, especially in deep learning, to improve model generation and prevent overfitting.

ML models reqiure large and varied datasets for initial training, but sourcing sufficiently diverse read-world dataset can be challenging because of the [data silos](data-silos.md), regulations, an other limitations. Data augmentation artificiallly increases the dataset by making small changes to the original data.

### Why is data augmentation important?

Deep learning models rely on large volumns of diverse data to develop accurate predictions in various contexts. Data augmentation supplements the creation of data variations that can help a model improve the accuracy of its predictions. Augmented data is vital in training.

Some of the benefits of the data segmentation.

##### Enhanced model performance

Data augmentation techniques help enrich datasets by creating many variations of existing data. This provides a larger dataset for training and enables a model to encounter more diverse features. The augmented data helps the model better generalize to unseen data and improve its overall performance in real-world environments.

##### Reduced data dependency

The collection and preparation of large data volumns for training can be costly and time-consuming. Data augmentation techniques increse the effectieness of smaller datasets, vastly reducing the dependency on large datasets in training environments. You can use smaller datasets to supplyment the set with synthetic data points.

##### Mitigate overfitting in training data

Data augmentation helps prevent overfitting when you're training ML models. Overfitting is the undesirable ML behavior where a model can accurately provide predictions for training data but it struggles with new data. If a model trains only with a narrow dataset, it can become overfit and can give predictions related to only that specific data type. In contrast, data augmentaion provides a much larger and more comprehensive dataset for model training. It makes training sets appear unique to deep neural networks, preventing them from learning to work with only specific characteristics.

##### Improved data privacy

If need to train a deep learning model on sensitive data, you can use augmentation techniques on the existing data to create synthetic data. This augmented data retains the input data's statistical properties and weights while protecting and limiting access to the original.

### What are the use cases of data augmentation?

Data augmentation offers several applications in various industries, improving the performance of ML models across many sectors.

##### Healthcare

Data augmentation is a useful technology in medical imaging because it helps improve daignostic models the detect, recognize, and diagnose diseases based on images. The creation of an augmented image provides more training data for models, espcially for rare diseases that lack source data variations. The production and use of synthetic patient data advances medical research while respectin all data privacy considerations.

##### Finance

Augmentation helps produce synthetic instances of fraud, enabling models to train to detect more accurately in real-world scenarios. Larger pools of training help in risk assessment scenarios, enhancing the potential of deep learning models to accurately access risk and predict future trends.

##### Manufacturing

The manufacturing industry uses ML models to identify visual defects in products. By supplymenting real-world data with augmented images, models can improve their image recognition capabilities and locate potential defects. This strategy also reduces the likelihood of shipping a damaged or defective project to factories and production lines.

##### Retail

Retail environment s use model to identify products and assign them to category based on visual factors. Data augmentation can product synthetic data variations of product images, creating a training set that has more variance in terms of lighting conditions, image backgrounds, and product angles.

### How does data augmentation work?

Data augmentation transforms, edits, or modifies existing data to create variations. The following is a belief overview of the process.

##### Dataset exploration

The first stage of data augmentation is to analyze an existing dataset and understand its characteristics. Features like the size of input images, the distribution of the data, or the text structure all give further context for augmentation.

You can select different data augmentation techniques based on the underlyig data type and the desired results. For exampe, augmenting a dataset with many images includes adding noise to them, scaling, or cropping them. Alternatively, augmenting test dataset for natural language processing.

##### Augmentation of existing data

After you've selected the data augmentation technique that work best for your desired goal, you begin applying different transformations. Data points or image samples in the dataset transform by using your selected agumentation method, providing a range of new augmented samples.

During the augmentation process, you maintina the same labeling rules for data consistency, ensuring that the synthetic data includes the same labels corresponding to the source data.


Typically, you look through the synthetic images to determine whether the transformation succeeded. This additional human-led step helps maintain higher data quality.

##### Integrate data forms

Next, you combine the new, augmented data with the original data to produce ta larger training dataset for the ML model. When you're training the model, you use his composist dataset of both kinds of data.

The new data points that are created by synthetic data augmentation carry the same [bais](bais.md) as the original input data. To prevent baises from transferring into your new data, address any bias in the source data before starting the data augmentation process.


### What are some data augmentation techniques?

Data augmentation tehcniques vary across different data types and distinct business contexts.

##### Computer vision

Data augmentation is a central technique in computer vision tasks. It help create diverse data representation and tackle class imbalances in a training dataset.

The first usage of augmentation in computer vision is through position augmentation. This strategy crops, flips, or rotates an input image to create augmented images. Croping either resizes the images or crops a small part of the original image to create a new one. Rotation, flip, and resizing transformation all alter the original randomly with a given probability of providing new images.

Another usage of augmentation in computer vision is in color augmentation. This strategy adjusts the elementary factors of a training image, such as it's brightlness, contract degree, or saturation. These common image transformation change the hue, dark, and light balence, and separation between an image's darkset and lightest areas to create augmented images.

##### Audio data augmentation

Audio files, such as speech recordings, are also a common field where you can use data augmentation. Audio transformations typically include injected random or Gaussian noise into some audio, fast-forwarding parts, changing the speed of the parts by a fixed rate, or altering the pitch.

##### Text data augmentation

Text augmentation is a vital data augmentation technique for NLP and other text-related sectors of ML. Transformations of text data include shuffling sentences, changing the positions of words, repalcing words with close synonyms, inserting random words, and deleting random words.

##### Neural style transfer

Neural style transger is an advanced form of data augmentation that deconstructs images into smaller parts. It uses a series of convolutional layers that separate the style and context of an image, producing many images from a single one.

##### Adversarial training

Changes on the pixel level create a challenge for an ML model. Some samples include a layer of impreceptible noise over an image to test the model's ability to preceive the image underneath. This strateg is a preventive form of data augmentation focuing on potential unauthorized access in-the real world.
