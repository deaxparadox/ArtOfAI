# Data augmentation

Data augmentation is a technique used to articially expand a dataset by applying transformations to existing data. It is commonly used in machine learning, especially in deep learning, to improve model generation and prevent overfitting.

ML models reqiure large and varied datasets for initial training, but sourcing sufficiently diverse read-world dataset can be challenging because of the [data silos](data-silos.md), regulations, an other limitations. Data augmentation artificiallly increases the dataset by making small changes to the original data.

### Why is data augmentation important?

Deep learning models rely on large volumns of diverse data to develop accurate predictions in various contexts. Data augmentation supplements the creation of data variations that can help a model improve the accuracy of its predictions. Augmented data is vital in training.

Some of the benefits of the data segmentation.

##### Enhanced model performance

Data augmentation techniques help enrich datasets by creating many variations of existing data. This provides a larger dataset for training and enables a model to encounter more diverse features. The augmented data helps the model better generalize to unseen data and improve its overall performance in real-world environments.

##### Reduced data dependency

The collection and preparation of large data volumns for training can be costly and time-consuming. Data augmentation techniques increse the effectieness of smaller datasets, vastly reducing the dependency on large datasets in training environments. You can use smaller datasets to supplyment the set with synthetic data points.

##### Mitigate overfitting in training data

Data augmentation helps prevent overfitting when you're training ML models. Overfitting is the undesirable ML behavior where a model can accurately provide predictions for training data but it struggles with new data. If a model trains only with a narrow dataset, it can become overfit and can give predictions related to only that specific data type. In contrast, data augmentaion provides a much larger and more comprehensive dataset for model training. It makes training sets appear unique to deep neural networks, preventing them from learning to work with only specific characteristics.

##### Improved data privacy

If need to train a deep learning model on sensitive data, you can use augmentation techniques on the existing data to create synthetic data. This augmented data retains the input data's statistical properties and weights while protecting and limiting access to the original.

### What are the use cases of data augmentation?

Data augmentation offers several applications in various industries, improving the performance of ML models across many sectors.

##### Healthcare

Data augmentation is a useful technology in medical imaging because it helps improve daignostic models the detect, recognize, and diagnose diseases based on images. The creation of an augmented image provides more training data for models, espcially for rare diseases that lack source data variations. The production and use of synthetic patient data advances medical research while respectin all data privacy considerations.

##### Finance

Augmentation helps produce synthetic instances of fraud, enabling models to train to detect more accurately in real-world scenarios. Larger pools of training help in risk assessment scenarios, enhancing the potential of deep learning models to accurately access risk and predict future trends.

##### Manufacturing

The manufacturing industry uses ML models to identify visual defects in products. By supplymenting real-world data with augmented images, models can improve their image recognition capabilities and locate potential defects. This strategy also reduces the likelihood of shipping a damaged or defective project to factories and production lines.

##### Retail

Retail environment s use model to identify products and assign them to category based on visual factors. Data augmentation can product synthetic data variations of product images, creating a training set that has more variance in terms of lighting conditions, image backgrounds, and product angles.
