#  Features

**Features are values in dataset (attributes, predictors, independent variables, dependent variables, etc.) on which, we performing tasks such are analyzing, modeling, etc.**

Either in Data analyst, Data science, Machine learning, or any field of **Artificial intelligence**, you must have come across the term *features*, it is confusing, because in different domain of AI, refering term varies. But, it's just a simple word used for referencing data or values in dataset.


### Machine learning

In machine learning while examing the data. Features are classified in the two types:

##### Dependent variables

These variables are which doesn't depending on any factors. For example, in collection of iris dataset, different species have different features *sepal_length*, *sepal_width*, *petal_length*, and *petal_width*. Here, these features are the independent variables. Based on these independent variables we classify the the Irises.

##### Independent variables

Independent variables, are variables which are directly affected with by change of dependent variable. As in the above example, we talked about Iris having differnt features. On the basis of those features we classify the Irises and assign them to different types of *species*, here species are dependent variables.
