# Sampling sentences from from language model

### Sampling

**Sampling from a distribution means to choose random points according to their likelihood**. Thus sampling from a language model--which represetns a distribution over sentences--means to generate some sentences, choosing each sentence according to its likehood as defined by the model.Thus we are more likely to generate sentences that the model thinks have high probablity and less likely to genrate sentences that the model thinks have a low probablity.
