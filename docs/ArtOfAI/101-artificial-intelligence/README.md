# Artificial intelligence (AI)

AI is used to classify machine that mimic human intelligence and human cognitive functions like problem-solving and learning. AI uses predictions and automation to optimize and solve complex tasks that human have historically done, such as facial recognition, decision-making and translation.


### Categories of AI

The three main categories of AI are:

- Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI)
- Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)
- Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI)


### Types of AI

1. [Weak AI](#weak-ai)
2. [Strong AI](#strong-ai)


### Weak AI

ANI is considered **weak** AI, by it ability to complete a specific task, like winning a chess game or identifying a particular individual in a series of photos. 

Natural language processing and computer vision, which let companies automate tasks and underpin chatbots and virtual assitants such as Siri and Alexa, are example of ANI.


### Strong AI

Stronger forms of AI, like AGI and ASI incorporate human behaviors more prominently, such as the ability to intepret tone and emotion. Strong AI is defined by its ability compared to humans.

AGI would perform on par with another human, while ASI--also known as superintelligence--would surpass a human's intelligence and ability.


### Using AI for business

Whether you use AI applications based on ML or foundation models, AI can give your business a competitive advantage. Integrating customized AI models into your workflows and systems, and automating functions such as customer service, supply chain management and cybersecurity, can help a business meet customers’ expectations, both today and as they increase in the future.


The development of [generative AI](https://), which uses powerful foundation models that train on large amounts of unlabeled data, can be adapted to new use cases and bring flexibility and scalability that is likely to accelerate the adoption of AI significantly.

The key is identifying the right data sets from the start to help ensure that you use quality data to achieve the most substantial competitive advantage. You’ll also need to create a hybrid, AI-ready architecture that can successfully use data wherever it lives—on mainframes, data centers, in private and public clouds and at the edge.
