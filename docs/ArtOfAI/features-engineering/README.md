# Feature Engineering

Feature engineering deals with features of the dataset, which form an important input of any machine learning problem -- the supervised or unsupervised learning. Feature engineering is a critical preparatory process in machine learning.  It is responsible for taking raw input data and converting that to well-aligned features which are ready to be used by the machine learning models.


**Unstructured data** is raw, unorganized data which doesn't follow specifc format or hierarchy. Typical examples of unstructured data include text data from social networks, e.g. Twitter, Facebook, etc. or data from server logs, etc.




----------


Data scientists and machine learning practitioners spend significant amount of time in different feature engineering activities. Selecting the right features has a cricital role to play in the success of a machine learning model.

- Feature construction expands the feature space.
- While, feature extraction and feature selection reduces the feature space.
