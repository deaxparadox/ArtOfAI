# What is feature?

A feature is an attribute of a data set that is used in a machine learning process. Some machine learning practitioners only consider those attributes as features which are  meaningfull to a machine learning problem. If fact, selection of the subset of features which are meaningful for machine learning is a sub-area of feature engineering which draws a lot of research interest. The features in a dataset are also called its dimensions. So a data set having *'n'* features is called *n*-dimensional data set.

Lets take the example of a famous machine learning dataset, Iris. It has five atributes or features name *sepal_length*, *sepal_width*, *petal_length*, *petal_width* and *species*. Out of which species represent the class variable and the remaining features are the **predictor variables**. it is a five dimesional data set.

# What is feature engineering?

Feature enginnering refers to the process of translating a data set into features such that these features are able to represent the dataset more effectively and result in a better learning performance.

Feature engineering is an important pre-precessing step for machine learning. It has two major  elements:

1. Feature transformation
2. Feature subset selection
