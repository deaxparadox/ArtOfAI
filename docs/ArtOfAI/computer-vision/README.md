# Computer Vision

### Image classification

In the image classification task, the network assigns a label (or class) to each input image

### Image segmentation

Suppose you want to know the shape of the object, which pixel belongs to which object, etc. In this case, you need to assign a class to each pixel of the image--this task is known as segmentation. A segmentation model returns much more details information about the image. Image segmentation has many applications in medical imaging, self-driving cars and satellite imaging.
