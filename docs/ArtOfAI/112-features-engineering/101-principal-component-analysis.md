### Introduction

Any machine learning algorithm performs better as the number of related attributes or features reduced. In other words, a key to the success of the machine learning lies in the fact that the features are less in number as well as the similarity between each other is very less. This is the main guiding philosophy of principal component analysis (PCA) technique of feature extraction.


In PCA, a new set of features are extracted from the original features which are quite dissimilar in nature. So an *n*-dimensional feature space gets transformed to an *m*-dimensional feature space, where the dimensions are orthogonal to each other, i.e. completely independent of each other.
