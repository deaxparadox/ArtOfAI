# Feature subset selection

Feature selection is arguably the most critical pre-processing activity in any machin learing project. It intends to select a subset of system attributes or features which makes a most meaningfull contribution in a machine learing activity.


### Issues in high-dimensional data

The text data generated from different sources have exteremly high dimensions (or consider any with thousands of features). In a large document corpus having few thousand documents embedded, the number of unique word tokens which represent the feature of the text data set, can also be in the range of a few tens of thousands. To get insight from such high-dimensional data may be a big challenge for a machine learning algorithm.
