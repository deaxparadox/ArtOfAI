### What are AI Agent?

AI agents are autonomous software programs that use artificial intelligence to perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific goals. They operate independently or interact with humans and other systems.

### Types Of AI Agents

1. Reactive Agents - Simple agents that respond to the current situation without memory (e.g., chess-playing AI).
2. Model-Based Agents - Main an internal models of the worlds to make informed decisions (e.g., self-driving cars).
3. Goal-Based Agents - Decide actions based on predefined goals and possible outcome (e.g., route optimization systems).
4. Utility-Based Agents - Evaluate different actions to maximize a utility function (e.g., recommendation systems).
5. Learning Agents - Continously improve performance based on past experiences (e.g., ChatGPT, reinforcement learning model).

### Applications of AI Agents
- Chatbots & Virtual Assistants (e.g., Siri, Alexa, ChatGPT)
- Autonomous Vehicles (e.g., Tesla's self-driving AI)
- Financial Trading Bots
- Healthcare Diagnosis Systems
- Game AI (NPCs in video games)
