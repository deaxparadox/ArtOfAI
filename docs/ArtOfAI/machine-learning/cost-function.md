### What is cost function?

A **cost function** (also called **error function**) helps to measure the extent to which the model is going wrong in estimating the relationship between *predictor variable(s)* X  and *target variable* Y. In that sense, cost function can tell how bad the model is performing. For example R-squared is a cost function of regression model.
