### Introduction

The learning process of machines may seem quite magincal to somebody who is new to machine learning. The thought that a machine is able to think and take intelligent action may be mesmerizing - much like a science fiction or a factasy story. However, delving a bit deeper helps them realize that it is not as magical as it may seem to be. In fact, tries to emulate human learning by applying mathematical and statistical formulations.  In that sense, both human and machine learning strives to build formulations or mapping based on a limited number of observations.

The basic learning processes, irrespective of the fact that the learner is a human or a machine, can be divided into three parts:

1. Data Input
2. Abstraction
3. Generalization

### What is ML?

Machine learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science that focuses on the using data and algorithms to enable AI to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy.

UK Berkeley breaks out the learning system of a machine learning algorithm into three main parts.

1. A **Decision Process**: In general, machine learning algorithms are used to make a prediction or classification. Based on some input data, which can be labeled or unlabeled, your algorithm will produce an estimate about a pattern in the data.

2. An **Error Function**: An error function evaluates the prediction of the model. If there are known examples, an error function can make a comparison to assess the accuracy of the model.

3. A **Model Optimization Process**: If the model can fit better to the data points in the training set, then weights are adjusted to reduce the descrepancy between the known example and the model estimate. The algorithm  will repeat this iterative "evaluate and optimize" process, updating weights autonomously until a threshold of accuracy has been met.


### Example 

In the introduction, we talk about the steps involed in the basic learning process.
