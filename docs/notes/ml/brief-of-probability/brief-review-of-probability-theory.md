    <ul>
        <li>
            <em>p(A)</em> denotes the probablity that the event <em>A</em> is true. For example, <em>A</em> might be logical statement &quot;Brazil is going to win the next football world cup final&quot;.
        </li>
        <li>
            The expression 0 &le; <em>p(A)</em> &le; 1 denotes that the probability of this event happening lies between 0 and 1, where <em>p(A)</em> = 0 means the event will definitely not happen, and <em>p(A)</em> = 1 means the event will definitely happen.
        </li>
        <li>
            The notation <em>p( ̅A )</em> or <em>p(A bar)</em>denotesthe probablity of the event not <em>A</em>; this is defined as <em>p( ̅A )</em> = 1 -  <em>p(A)</em>. It is common practice to write *A* = 1 to mean the event <em>A</em> is true, and <em>A</em> == 0 to mean the event <em>A</em> is false. So, this is binary event where the event is either true or false but can't be something indefinite.
        </li>
        <li>
            The probability of selecting an event <em>A</em>, from a sample size of <em>X</em> is defined as <em>p(A) = n / X</em>, where <em>n</em> is the number of times the instance of event <em>A</em> is present in the sample of size <em>X</em>.
        </li>
