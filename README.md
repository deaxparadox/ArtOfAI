### Data collection

In this step data is collected from various sources, from companies, by extracting web pages, from internet (download datasets), etc.


### Basics Terminologies:
- [Features](/docs/glossary/features.md)


### Data pre-processing

Data pre-processing is important step of machine learning where data is thoroughly analyized, data is processing in structred format, outliers are removed, visualized repersentaion is done for gettting the insights. Then, the required set of features are selected or engineered, which will be used for creating a models.

### Preparing to models



### Machine Learning

Machine learing is the branch of AI in which models is trained of the given, that model is used for prediction, classifcation etc.

##### Type of machine learning

- [Supervised machine learning](/docs/ArtOfAI/supervised-learning/README.md)
- [Unsuperused machine learning](/docs/ArtOfAI/unsupervised-learning/README.md)
- [Semi-supervised machine learning](https://)
- [Reinforcement learning](https://)


### Neural Networks

A neural network is a machine learning program, or model, that makes decisions in a manner similar to the human brain, by using processes that mimic the way biological neurons work together to identify phenomena, weigh options and arrive at conclusions.

# Libraries and Frameworks

Following are the categorised list of libraries which used in the different fields of Artificial intelligence. There are some many libraries and frameworks which belong to one domain but also used others, such tensorflow and pytorch is used in broad range of domains in AI. It is used in building simple ML models, neural networks, deep learning, etc.
