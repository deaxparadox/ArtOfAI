### Data collection

In this step data is collected from various sources, from companies, by extracting web pages, from internet (download datasets), etc.


### Basics Terminologies:
- [Features](/docs/glossary/features.md)


### Data pre-processing

Data pre-processing is important step of machine learning where data is thoroughly analyized, data is processing in structred format, outliers are removed, visualized repersentaion is done for gettting the insights. Then, the required set of features are selected or engineered, which will be used for creating a models.

### Preparing to models

This stage consist various steps we need to take before we starting build our models, to do the specific tasks.

### Machine Learning

Machine learing is the branch of AI in which models is trained of the given, that model is used for prediction, classifcation etc.

### Neural Networks

A neural network is a machine learning program, or model, that makes decisions in a manner similar to the human brain, by using processes that mimic the way biological neurons work together to identify phenomena, weigh options and arrive at conclusions.

### Deep learning

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning methods based on neural networks with representation learning. It uses multilayered neural networks, called deep neural networks, to stimulate the complex decision-making power of the human brain.

### Computer vision

Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that uses machine learning and neural networks to teach computers and systems to derive meaningful information from digital images, videos and other visual inputs—and to make recommendations or take actions when they see defects or issues.

### Generative AI

Generative AI, sometimes called gen AI, is artificial intelligence (AI) that can create original content—such as text, images, video, audio or software code—in response to a user’s prompt or request.

### MLOps

MLOps is emerging branch which combined the ML, AI and DevOps, simplyfing the models development and deployment process.
