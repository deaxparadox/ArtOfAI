### Data collection

In this step data is collected from various sources, from companies, by extracting web pages, from internet (download datasets), etc.

- For scraping the webpages, following tools are used in python
    - [requests](https://): library for download the content of the website.
    - [BeautfulSoup](https://): It library is used for parsing the content of the web pages.
    - [Selenium](https://): Framework for performing, extraction (optional), web automation and testing.
    - [Scrapy](https://): Framework for web scraping.

### Basics Terminologies:
- [Features](/docs/glossary/features.md)


### Data pre-processing

Data pre-processing is important step of machine learning where data is thoroughly analyized, data is processing in structred format, outliers are removed, visualized repersentaion is done for gettting the insights. Then, the required set of features are selected or engineered, which will be used for creating a models.

##### Data pre-processing libraries

Following are the libraries used for data preprocesing:

- [Numpy](https://)
- [Pandas](https://)
- Visualization
    - [Matplotlib](https://)
    - [Seaborn](https://)
    - [Folium](https://)

### Preparing to models



### Machine Learning

Machine learing is the branch of AI in which models is trained of the given, that model is used for prediction, classifcation etc.

##### Type of machine learning

- [Supervised machine learning](/docs/ArtOfAI/supervised-learning/README.md)
- [Unsuperused machine learning](https://)
- [Semi-supervised machine learning](https://)
- [Reinforcement learning](https://)


##### Python libraries of Modeling:

- [Scikit-learn](https://)
- [XGboost](https://)
- [Catboost](https://)
- [Tensorflow](https://)
- [Pytorch](https://)



### Neural Networks

A neural network is a machine learning program, or model, that makes decisions in a manner similar to the human brain, by using processes that mimic the way biological neurons work together to identify phenomena, weigh options and arrive at conclusions.
