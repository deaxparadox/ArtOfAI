# Underfitting

Underfitting refers to a model that can neither model the training data nor generalize to new data.

An underfit machine learning model is not suitable model and will be obivious as it will have poor performance on the training data.

### How To Limit Underfitting?

1. Using more training data
2. Reducing features by effective feature selection
