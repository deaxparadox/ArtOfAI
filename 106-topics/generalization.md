# Generalization

In machine learning we describe the learning of the target function from training data as inductive learning.

Induction refers to learning general concepts from specifc examples which is exactly the problem that supervised machine learning problems aims to solve. This is different from deduction that is the other way around and seeks to learn specific concepts from genral rules.

Generalization refers to how well the concepts learned by a machine learning model apply to specific examples not seen be the model when it was learning.

The goal of a good machine learning models is to generalize well from the training data to any data from the problem domain. This allows us to make predictions in the future on data the model was never seen.

There is a terminology used in machine learning when we talk about how well a machine learning models learning and generalizes to new data, namely overfitting and underfitting.


Overfitting and Underfitting are the two biggest causes of poort performance of machine learning algorithms.
