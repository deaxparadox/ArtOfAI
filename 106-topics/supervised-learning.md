# Supervised learning


##### Description or glossary

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm learns from labelled data. Labelled data means the dataset whose respective target value is already known. Supervised learning has two types:

- **Classification**: It predicts the class of the dataset based on the independent input variable. Class is the categorical or discrete values, like the image of an animal is a cat or dog?

- **Regression**: It predicts the continous output variables based on the independent input variable, like the prediction of house prices based on different parameters like house age, distance from the main road, location, area, etc.
